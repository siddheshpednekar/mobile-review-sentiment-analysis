But it could have been better if the display was at least IPS LCD not TFT.And other thing that I want to say is kudos to samsung for making me a part of saving the environment by not giving the charger in the box. Now I have to buy a separate charger for this, which will add more plastic content in the environment.Great initiative by samsung in this mid range segment, not giving a charger in the box.READ MORE Don't buy this mobile from online..There is no charger in the box.

Even to swipe on number, you have to wait for 2 seconds to see the calling option.  And the worst part is charger. It doesn't come with charger, so you have to buy it separately.
